        p
          | We spent a year and a half thinking about and testing the right nonviolent strategy for the migrant rights movement in this country.
        p
          | We launched our movement with a national training in Wisconsin in July. Since then, we've doubled in size! We're now in Arizona, California, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin.

            | All financial support is welcome. Expense decisions are made by
            | circle (team) members and is based on their budget priorities.
          p
            | For example, right now our biggest need is to help financially support the basic needs of our volunteer organizers (food, rent, flights, etc.) and purchase materials for our merchandise, which we use to fundraise in a grassroots manner. In the future, the biggest needs might be to put on a local training or support a family who is a part of the strike. Again, each expense is decided by a circle of members.
          p
            | So that some circles don’t accumulate more monetary power than others, we will only accept $5,000 in donations per project or village.
          p Examples: 
          ul
            li $5,000 for the Homestead, Florida Strike Fund
            li $5,000 for the Portland, Oregon Boycott Fund
            li $5,000 for the Phoenix, Arizona Local Training Fund
