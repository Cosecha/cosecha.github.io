				h4#faq1 What does Cosecha aim to achieve? 
				p Cosecha is a popular movement for the permanent protection, respect, and dignity of all immigrants. Our grand strategy to win is divided into 4 phases, culminating in a general strike of millions of workers and students. This is not a legislative campaign, meaning that our movement is not aimed at a particular politician or CEO. However, we do expect permanent protection to be legislated by the end of our strike. 

				p The immigrant rights movement has historically been very legislative- over the past 15 years there have been many iterations of an immigration reform bill, and well resourced campaigns to push for a bipartisan “common sense immigration reform”. Our analysis is that the immigrant rights movement has not failed to achieve permanent protection from deportation and equal rights for undocumented immigrants because of a lack of policy proposals or insiders in Washington willing to negotiate a solution. What has been missing over the past two decades is a popular movement on the streets creating a moral dilemma for our country that forces Washington to finally make good on its long overdue promise to the immigrant community. If we can move the public, decision makers will follow. This a movement for what the community needs: a permanent right to stay.

				hr

				h4#faq2 Why do we need a movement for permanent protection, respect, and dignity, for all immigrants?
				p  The current political and social climate in the United States is disturbingly anti-immigrant. With the threat of a Trump presidency, overt xenophobia and racism have become visible and accepted. However, Republicans are not the only threat to the immigrant community. Obama has deported more immigrants than any other president and is currently carrying out raids targeting Central American women and children. No matter how strong the immigrant rights movement has been in the past, we have never had enough power to be able to win more than a temporary work permit. In 2012, after losing a fight for the DREAM Act, which would have provided a path to legalization for undocumented students, Obama granted undocumented youth a work permit through the program DACA. Obama’s executive order in 2014 granting a work permit for undocumented parents of children who are citizens or legal residents has yet to be issued because it got held up by an injunction in the court system. 

				hr

				h4#faq3 How is Cosecha different from other immigrant rights movements or organizations? 
				p Cosecha is not an organization. Cosecha is building towards something that has never been done in the history of the immigrant rights movement and has not been done in the recent history of any movement in the United States: a general strike. No matter how powerful the immigrant rights movement has been in the past, we have never had enough political power to win permanent protection. Cosecha believes that immigrants'  strongest weapon is their contribution to this country as workers and consumers. The United States economy would collapse without immigrant labor and consumer power. The only way to demonstrate sufficient power as an immigrant community so that permanent protection can even be negotiated is to have a general strike of workers across sectors and students. 

				hr 

				h4#faq4 Are there past or current movements that Cosecha's model is based on? 
				p Cosecha deeply honors our movement ancestors. We have learned about how to build powerful popular movements from the Civil Rights Movement, the Otpor student movement in Serbia, and the United Farm Workers. Our theory of change is also informed by the work of Erica Chenoweth, a civil resistance scholar who analyzed the factors determining success in over 300 social movements aimed at advancing major social reforms as well as regime change.

				hr

				h4#faq5 Why did Cosecha open its first house in Boston?
				p Cosecha opened its first volunteer organizer house in Boston because of the institutional resources available to Cosecha that were concentrated in Boston, particularly from the Ayni Institute. Cosecha aims to have started over 60 houses in different states by the time of the general strike. 

				hr

				h4#faq6 What milestones has Cosecha achieved so far?
				p Cosecha's strategy, principles, and structure were developed over a year and a half period by a small group of immigrant rights activists called the Honesty Team. The members of the Honesty Team came from all across the United States, and most were undocumented or had undocumented family members. They convened for the first time in April 2014, and launched the movement through a training in Milwaukee WI in July of 2015. Since then, the movement has been growing across the country. We opened the first house of Cosecha volunteer organizers in February 2016 in East Boston, and we just opened the second house in Harrison, NJ in June! We now have Cosecha villages (our primary form of organization) in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Florida, Minnesota, Arizona, and California.

				hr 

				h4#faq7 Who are volunteer organizers?
				p Volunteer organizers are folks who have decided to dedicate 100% of their time to supporting the development of Cosecha and are supported financially and emotionally by living in a Cosecha House. Organizers live by an ethic of voluntary simplicity, in which they fundraise directly from the community for all of their basic needs (rent, utilities, food, a small weekly stipend) and live in a supportive, intentional community. This allows us to grow our capacity quickly with relatively limited resources. We are replicating a model that has been used in many other social movements, including the Indian Independence Movement and the United Farm Worker boycotts. The Cosecha Houses are meant to exist in deep reciprocity with the surrounding community and Cosecha villages, where the community supports the houses and the houses in turn support the movement.

				hr 

				h4#faq8 Why isn’t Cosecha a 501c(3)? 
				p Cosecha is a self-organizing popular movement, not a 501c(3). A self-organizing popular movement means that there are structures in place that allow anyone who follows the strategy and principles of Cosecha to form their own village. This way, Cosecha can grow to scale. Cosecha would not be able absorb the millions of people we aim to mobilize or be able to grow across so many different cities under the structure of a 501c(3). 

				hr

				h4#faq9 How can I make a contribution?
				p We invite everyone to become a monthly sustainer of the Boston Cosecha House online at https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/sustain-cosecha. Monthly sustainers help ensure that the Cosecha House receives a guaranteed income each month in order to meet our monthly budget. You can also make a 1-time contribution in cash, a check made out to Cosecha and sent to 114 Gladstone St. Boston MA 02128, or online at https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-cosecha.

				hr

				h4#faq10 How will my contribution be used?
				p Your contribution will go towards meeting the monthly needs of the Boston Cosecha House. Supporting the House is currently one of the best ways to support the development of the movement in general. The Boston Cosecha House has a budget of approximately $4500/month. We already have around 115 monthly sustainers which donate approximately $2250/month! This means that we need around $2,000 more a month to meet our budget. 

				hr

				h4#faq11 How can I learn more about movement building?
				p A great resource is Paul Engler's book This is an Uprising. Much of Cosecha's theory around building mass popular movements and shifting public opinion is drawn from this book. We also suggest that you attend any of the movement building trainings put on by the Ayni Institute (www.ayni.institute)

				hr

				h4#faq12 How can I stay involved?
				p Check out our website at movimientocosecha.com! You can also find us on Facebook at Movimiento Cosecha - Harvest Movement and at our Friends of Cosecha page. Each of our local Cosecha "villages" has its own Facebook page as well. For Massachusetts, there is a Cosecha Boston page and Cosecha Lawrence page. 

				p You can also join one of our villages! Since Cosecha is a popular movement, anyone can join a Cosecha village as long as they follow the principles and strategy of Cosecha. The two Cosecha villages in Massachusetts are currently Boston and Lawrence. If you want to join the Lawrence village, you can contact Emily Bloch (bloch.emily@gmail.com) or Nataly Castaño (nataly.castaño@gmail.com). If you want to join the Boston village, you can contact Conrado Santos (conradofsantos@simforus.com) or Gloribell Mota (gmota@nubeastboston.org). With any difficulties, feel free to contact Phoebe Gardener at phoebe.gardener@gmail.com.
