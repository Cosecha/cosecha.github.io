	"history_1": "We are the Cosecha Movement - named to honor the thousands of undocumented workers that provide food to our many tables today and for the legacy of the millions of workers that were forced to be slaves to provide for the accumulation of this country.",
	"history_2": "We are part of a legacy of movements in this country. We are students of the thousands of farmworkers that stood up to the exploitation with the leadership of Dolores Huerta, Larry Itliong and Cesar Chavez, and students of the thousands of African-Americans that stood up to the racist Jim Crow system all over this country.",
	"history_3": "From our past, we learned that all this pain - the raids, the separation, the deportations, the exploitation - continues because we allow it to.",
	"history_4": "From our people, we heard that our greatest powers are our spending money and our bodies that are made invisible but provide so much sustenance to this country. We heard that we need to do a general strike.",
	"history_5": "So we spent a year and a half thinking about and testing the right nonviolent strategy for the immigrant rights movement in this country.",
	"history_6": "We launched our movement with a national training in Wisconsin in July. Since then, we've grown enormously and just had the first Cosecha National Assembly in May 2016!",

	"principle_01_title": "Monkey see, monkey do",
	"principle_01_body": "We lead by inspiring and suggesting, never by commanding. Our leaders are but trusty servants; they do not govern. We all take initiative and respect those of others. It’s not about one idea; it’s about many good ideas. As we continue embodying/living out movement values, we remember that principles come before personality.",


	"principle_02_title": "We are all a family",
	"principle_02_body": "This movement welcomes everyone from different countries, ethnicities, races, genders, sexual orientations, religious and spiritual beliefs. We know the wisdom of our movement comes from the voices that are often the most silenced. Since the dominant language can take over a space and silence the people who don’t feel comfortable with the words, we have the “multilingual-rule” which is about making every space open to multiple languages. We operate in the languages that come easily to our community.",


	"principle_03_title": "There is no cover for this party.",
	"principle_03_body": "You don’t need permission to participate in this movement. This becomes a reality when we see how our “3-activist rule” works. The rule says that when 3 people decide to become activists in Harvest, they can form a circle and get full support from the movement. We make our own decisions in our circles and we choose to participate in the activities of the movement that we feel most excited about. We can party together as long as we follow the principles of our Harvest. There is no dress code for this party. Our movement needs musicians, artists, dancers, creatives, mothers, daughters, workers, street-intellectuals, poets, academics, students, etc. We encourage risk-taking because the diversity of our creativity will help us find the most effective strategies, tools, actions, and virialization of our movement. Promotion for actions. attraction for trainings and absorption for unity.",


	"principle_04_title": "We don’t dance with political parties.",
	"principle_04_body": "We are tired of broken promises by political parties. They want our phone numbers for their elections but never call us after they’re elected. Our work is on the streets and with the people — we are not focused on politicians. Our target is the people — we will only engage politicians and their supporters to get them to take a leave of absence from their parties. We don’t have external representatives or advocates; we speak for ourselves. If the political leadership(president and congress) make a commitment to pass legislation that might give us permanent protection we will use 60-day rule, the rule is about everyone in Cosecha giving the parties a 60 day deadline in order for them to enact permanent protection if not we continue with the current phase at the 60 day mark regardless of more promises.",


	"principle_05_title": "Our weapon is non-cooperation",
	"principle_05_body": "We know our power is rooted in non-cooperation with the current political, social and economic systems. Without working hands, there is no labor: we won’t cooperate until this country recognizes it depends on us.",


	"principle_06_title": "Our shield is nonviolence",
	"principle_06_body": "Non-violence keeps our movement alive. It is our shield that reflects the true perpetrators of the state violence that our people suffer from daily. It is our strategy to bring light to the injustice that we suffer every day. We feel pain from the abuses of the police and others, and we will keep exposing their violence through our discipline.",


	"principle_07_title": "The soil of our harvest is respect and reciprocity",
	"principle_07_body": "The ground on which this movement stands is on the relationships of its participants. We will work every day to build trust, respect and reciprocity among all of us. We assume all harvesters have good intentions and also react immediately against disrespect. We use conflict resolution techniques to deal with conflict in a healthy way that will bring growth to our movement. We ground our work in dialogue, healing, and collective transformation. We won’t tolerate shaming of each other and bullying towards the many organizations and leaders of the immigrant rights movement.",


	"principle_08_title": "Our seeds come from the tree of sacrifice.",
	"principle_08_body": "We honor the hard work of all the people who bring their gifts to the movement. We believe that people’s work in Harvest is for the collective well-being of everyone and not for personal gain or to advance individual interests. While most of the work of the movement is not financially compensated, there are some positions that movement leaders can sponsor in order to create more support for the movement. Those positions will be compensated based on needs and not by a market employment rate. They are temporary and only meant to support the movement at key moments.",


	"principle_09_title": "All we need is already within our community now.",
	"principle_09_body": "We know that when we get BIG money it’s because they want to control our movement, that is why we are always self-sustaining. We know that all the resources we need, including financial, are already in our community.",


	"principle_10_title": "You can wear our colors as long as you follow our principles.",
	"principle_10_body": "Any organization can use the Harvest flag as long as they follow our principles. Anyone can join. Formal organizations (outside of Harvest) must join support circles with other Harvest activists as long they accept our strategy and story of the movement. No formal organization can request resources in the name of Harvest unless they are resources distributed among our villages",


	"principle_11_title": "One harvest, many fruits.",
	"principle_11_body": "There are thousands of ways to be part of the Harvest strategy. We encourage daily autonomy and creativity in how to implement the movement based on people’s conditions. At the same time, our movement unity depends on all our teams working together and following our greatest agreement: our Harvest principles. The principles are the music score of our Harvest orchestra and all the instruments are the creativity of our activist.",


	"principle_12_title": "We are one of many harvests.",
	"principle_12_body": "We know the injustices of our community cannot be undone with just one movement. We know that the systems of domination require multiple cycles of movements that are working for many decades to bring reciprocity and balance to our communities. Harvest is just one piece of a larger justice puzzle.",


	"principle_13_title": "This swarm needs all its bees.",
	"principle_13_body": "This movement will take all of us. While some of us are more focused on taking care of our community, others are more called to be prophetic voices to bring people into the movement. We all have different callings and roles that we want to take on. Our spirit of coordination comes together as we affirm, “If you’re stuck, buzz”. This means that if you need help, just ask for it. We can only be a movement if we support each other. We also know people are part of various organizations and that people can be in and out of Harvest and we make a distinction between the participation of individuals and organizations.",


	"principle_14_title": "An injustice somewhere is a threat to justice everywhere.",
	"principle_14_body": "We know the undocumented community is not the only one facing oppression and that this system of inequality has been going on for a long time. We believe that our movement’s mission is to be active in other movements for racial, gender and economic justice.",

	// FAQ section
	"faq": "FAQ",

	"faq1-q": "What does Cosecha aim to achieve?",
	"faq1-a-1": "Cosecha is a popular movement for the permanent protection, respect, and dignity of all immigrants. Our grand strategy to win is divided into 4 phases, culminating in a general strike of millions of workers and students. This is not a legislative campaign, meaning that our movement is not aimed at a particular politician or CEO. However, we do expect permanent protection to be legislated by the end of our strike.",
	"faq1-a-2": "The immigrant rights movement has historically been very legislative- over the past 15 years there have been many iterations of an immigration reform bill, and well resourced campaigns to push for a bipartisan “common sense immigration reform”. Our analysis is that the immigrant rights movement has not failed to achieve permanent protection from deportation and equal rights for undocumented immigrants because of a lack of policy proposals or insiders in Washington willing to negotiate a solution. What has been missing over the past two decades is a popular movement on the streets creating a moral dilemma for our country that forces Washington to finally make good on its long overdue promise to the immigrant community. If we can move the public, decision makers will follow. This a movement for what the community needs: a permanent right to stay.",

	"faq2-q": "Why do we need a movement for permanent protection, respect, and dignity, for all immigrants?",
	"faq2-a-1": "The current political and social climate in the United States is disturbingly anti-immigrant. With the threat of a Trump presidency, overt xenophobia and racism have become visible and accepted. However, Republicans are not the only threat to the immigrant community. Obama has deported more immigrants than any other president and is currently carrying out raids targeting Central American women and children. No matter how strong the immigrant rights movement has been in the past, we have never had enough power to be able to win more than a temporary work permit. In 2012, after losing a fight for the DREAM Act, which would have provided a path to legalization for undocumented students, Obama granted undocumented youth a work permit through the program DACA. Obama’s executive order in 2014 granting a work permit for undocumented parents of children who are citizens or legal residents failed after it did not pass the Supreme Court.",

	"faq3-q": "How is Cosecha different from other immigrant rights movements or organizations?",
	"faq3-a-1": "Cosecha is not an organization. Cosecha is building towards something that has never been done in the history of the immigrant rights movement and has not been done in the recent history of any movement in the United States: a general strike. No matter how powerful the immigrant rights movement has been in the past, we have never had enough political power to win permanent protection. Cosecha believes that immigrants'  strongest weapon is their contribution to this country as workers and consumers. The United States economy would collapse without immigrant labor and consumer power. The only way to demonstrate sufficient power as an immigrant community so that permanent protection can even be negotiated is to have a general strike of workers across sectors and students.",

	"faq4-q": "Are there past or current movements that Cosecha's model is based on?",
	"faq4-a-1": "Cosecha deeply honors our movement ancestors. We have learned about how to build powerful popular movements from the Civil Rights Movement, the Otpor student movement in Serbia, and the United Farm Workers. Our theory of change is also informed by the work of Erica Chenoweth, a civil resistance scholar who analyzed the factors determining success in over 300 social movements aimed at advancing major social reforms as well as regime change.",

	"faq6-q": "How was Cosecha created and what milestones has Cosecha achieved so far?",
	"faq6-a-1": "Cosecha's strategy, principles, and structure were developed over a year and a half period by a small group of immigrant rights activists called the Honesty Team. The members of the Honesty Team came from all across the United States, and most were undocumented or had undocumented family members. They convened for the first time in April 2014, and launched the movement through a training in Milwaukee WI in July of 2015. Since then, the movement has been growing across the country. We opened the first house of Cosecha volunteer organizers in February 2016 in East Boston, and we just opened the second house in Harrison, NJ in June! We now have Cosecha villages (our primary form of organization) in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Florida, Minnesota, Arizona, and California.",

	"faq7-q": "Who are volunteer organizers and why do they live in Cosecha Houes?",
	"faq7-a-1": "Volunteer organizers are folks who have decided to dedicate 100% of their time to supporting the development of Cosecha and are supported financially and emotionally by living in a Cosecha House. Organizers live by an ethic of voluntary simplicity, in which they fundraise directly from the community for all of their basic needs (rent, utilities, food, a small weekly stipend) and live in a supportive, intentional community. This allows us to grow our capacity quickly with relatively limited resources. We are replicating a model that has been used in many other social movements, including the Indian Independence Movement and the United Farm Worker boycotts. The Cosecha Houses are meant to exist in deep reciprocity with the surrounding community and Cosecha villages, where the community supports the houses and the houses in turn support the movement.",

	"faq8-q": "Why isn’t Cosecha a 501c(3)?",
	"faq8-a-1": "Cosecha is a self-organizing popular movement, not a 501c(3). A self-organizing popular movement means that there are structures in place that allow anyone who follows the strategy and principles of Cosecha to form their own village. This way, Cosecha can grow to scale. Cosecha would not be able absorb the millions of people we aim to mobilize or be able to grow across so many different cities under the structure of a 501c(3).",

	"faq9-q": "How can I make a contribution?",
	"faq9-a-1": "You can make contributions to 3 Cosecha Houses: Boston, MA; Harrison, NJ; and California. We invite everyone to become a monthly sustainer of the Cosecha Houses. Monthly sustainers help ensure that the Cosecha Houses receive a guaranteed income each month in order to meet our monthly budget.",
	"faq9-a-2": "Boston, MA: Monthly sustainer: https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/sustain-cosecha-2?source=direct_link&. 1-time donation: https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-cosecha?source=direct_link& ",

	"faq9-a-4": "California: Monthly sustainer: https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/sustain-ca-cosecha-house. 1-time donation: https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-ca-cosecha-house. ",

	"faq10-q": "How will my contribution be used?",
	"faq10-a-1": "Your contribution will go towards meeting the monthly needs of the Houses. Supporting the House is currently one of the best ways to support the development of the movement in general. The Houses generally have a budget of between $3500 - $4500/month. ",

	"faq11-q": "How can I learn more about movement building?",
	"faq11-a-1": "A great resource is Paul Engler's book This is an Uprising. Much of Cosecha's theory around building mass popular movements and shifting public opinion is drawn from this book. We also suggest that you attend any of the movement building trainings put on by the Ayni Institute (www.ayni.institute)",

	"bbu-p1": "Thirty- five years ago, Trump Tower was built by 200 undocumented immigrants paid $5 a day, if that! Despite having relied on our labor to make his millions, Donald Trump has the audacity to base his presidential platform on hate, racism, and ignorance against the immigrant community. Cosecha is here to highlight the hypocrisy of the anti-immigrant sentiment that is resonating with the American public in the moments leading up to the 2016 November elections. Trump is not the first, and won’t be the last, public figure to make a political career based on the scapegoating of immigrant communities. Cosecha is here to channel the fear and frustration existent within the immigrant community into action. We want to send the American public a message: this country was built by us, so we will use our labor and consumer power to demand permanent protection, dignity, and respect for our immigrant community.",
	"bbu-h1": "Immigrants Confront Trump & Reclaim Dignity",
	"bbu-p2": "On August 31, 2016, ten immigrants led a civil disobedience at Trump Tower to send the message that the tower, and this country, was #BuiltByUs. We are the pillars that holds this country up, and without us, it will fall. As immigrants, we feel a burning indignation when we listen to politicians, the media, and Trump supporters give reasons why we should be deported; why our families should be separated; why our contributions to this country hold no value. We can no longer be silent as we listen to hatred and xenophobia in the airwaves. Instead, Cosecha will amplify the voices of our people-- of our struggles, pains, and hope for the future to reclaim dignity & respect for ourselves and win permanent protection for our people.",
